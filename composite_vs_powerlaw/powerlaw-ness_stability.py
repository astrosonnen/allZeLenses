# In all H0licow lenses studied so far, the H0 inferred with powerlaw is always very close to that inferred with the composite model. Why is that?
# What kind of true density profile do you need for that to happen?
# If the true density profile is a power-law, it's not obvious that you can fit it with a composite model and get out the same H0.
# Similarly, if the true density profile is composite, fitting it with a power-law will in general give you the wrong H0.
# In this code, I assume the truth to be composite. I take lenses from the existing mocks, then select the ones for which a power-law model gives the same H0 (based on the relation between psi'' and psi''').
# Then I modify lens and source redshift in order to get a different Einstein radius. Is the power-law approximation still valid?
