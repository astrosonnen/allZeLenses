# All Ze Lenses

We imagine a brave new world full of gravitational lenses - thousands of 
them! - detected by LSST and Euclid. How can we use them to mitigate the 
key systematic error in strong lens cosmography (the unknown lens density 
profile) and make accurate measurements of the expansion of the Universe?
